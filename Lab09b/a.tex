\section{Dividing tasks among team members}

This is still a pretty small program, which means dividing it into chunks is 
not super necessary. It would likely take a motivated student on the order of 
one hour to do it. That said, the easiest way to divide up the work among four 
people is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Get user input
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Save the values to agreed upon variable names
		\end{itemize}
	\item Output data
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This includes data from person 1 {\textbf and} person 3
		\end{itemize}
	\item Calculate y-value from inputted x-value
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Use variables established by person 1
			\item Only needs to write one iteration (putting it in a loop is easy)
		\end{itemize}
	\item Combine and test
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This can only be done {\textbf after} everybody else is done
			\item Should perform both unit and integration tests
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Dividing testing among team members}

As established above, the primary responsibility of testing is on person 4.
Person 4 should provide some testing data to each person as part of their role.
However, each person should perform their own testing to ensure correctness of
their code. Person 4 is responsible for integration testing: i.e. establishing
that all the individual parts of code will work together.
